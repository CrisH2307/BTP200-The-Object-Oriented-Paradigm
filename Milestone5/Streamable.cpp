Date        Reason
2023/07/02  Preliminary release

I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

MILESTONE JOURNAL:

MS1:
07/03: Beginning the MS1
07/05: Debugging Error
07/08: I'm confused whether create the default construcor or just need to create custom constructor
07/09: Segmentation Fault (Solved by Professor Jeevan Pant)
07/12: Menu Debugging Error, the problem is viewMenu and viewTitle, I separated them out because
it was easy to call the ostream helper function (Helper: Sean Muniz and Sukhman Hara)
07/13: Date Debugging Error, read and write function. cin failed didn't even print out.
I tried many times until I put os << displayTitle(os); (Initial I didnt put os) (Helper: Sean Muniz)
07/13: Small display error, and finished the MS1

MS2:
07/10: Start working on MS2, set attributes and implement LibApp.cpp
07/13: Start debugging on MS2, i didnt know how to implement the confirm when i need to
add Yes. Until my friend help me for using the attribute << "Yes". (Helper: Preet Patel)
07/14: Run function's errors because my loop was infinite until I saw that the issue
that I got is i made a wrong bool value when inside the loop (true ==> false, Helper: Mandhav and Preet Patel)
07/14: Finished

MS3:
07/21: Started MS3
07/22: Debug errors (Segmentation Fault)
07/24: I was stuck with copy assignment and copy constructor(Helper: Sean Muniz, Kabir Nalula)
07/25: Stuck with write and read function (Helper: Preet Patel, Nand Patel, Sukhman Hara)
07/28: Fix some format error and fill char, finished


MS4:
07/25: Started declare and implement the function
07/31: Finished the implementation, but memory leaks and segmentation fault
08/01: Debug the error, the memory leaks on Publication and Book, also
istream error that didnt print 220 lines of book (Helper: Sean Muniz)
08/01: Finised MS4


MS5:
07/19: Started MS5
07/20: Working on method, attributes and functions 
07/23: Implement the cpp file, add PublicSelector modules
07/28: Fixing compiler errors from publication because the format error
07/31: Fixing logic error from the menu, LibApp for the publication selector
08/01: Finished fixing Publication and Menu. Debug error starts with leaks segmentation fault
08/02: Adding Python auto input files, finished the compilation but logic error
08/03: Debug Problem 1: New Publication function, Load function
+ When I tried to input the publication, it didnt ignore the new line and kept me a blank space, 
I was helped my Sean Muniz and Madhav Rajpall for get rid of cin.lcear and cin.ignore() on Publication
beacuse I had already called the ignore on LilApp, and I need to delete one on Publication
+ Load and save function gave me memory leaks, Sean Muniz helped me fixing by passing the dereference instead of
local variable
08/03: Debug Problem 2: Remove and Search function
+ Remove Publication gave me too much ignore line, I decided to get rid of the getline and ignore on the LibApp function
+ Search is the most difficult fuction that I have done for MS5. I couldn't understand what should I return the function(int or void).
Sean Muniz and Sukhman Hara gave me advices and fix the return function so that when I call search for Publication fucntions, I can
call the argument and then it will return the number that it can pass the logic on every Publication function.
08/04: Debug Problem 3: Memory leaks
+ Today, I haven't even test any milestone test beacuse it gave me too much memory leaks.
+ Sean Muniz and Madhav Rajpall helped me to fix the leak by making Destructor, the instruction didnt say anything about it.
Also I just got rid of Default Constructor because the tester calls with argument, so I just needed to create only one 
constructor with a parameter.
08/05: Tested, compilation and endl
+ I just got some formatting error, I forgot endl, forgot to unsetf
+ However the all program was successful
+ Finished MS5 with 6 tests

Milestone form 1 to 5 Helper:
+ Sean Muniz
+ Preet Patel
+ Madhav Rajpall
+ Kabir Narula
+ Nand Patel
+ Joseph Chu
+ Sukhman Hara
