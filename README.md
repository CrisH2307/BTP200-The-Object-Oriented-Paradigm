Part #1<br>
Missing Ownership/Citation Comments ➠ All the files that you submit must contain your name, student id, and your Seneca email. There is a reminder just before you submit the files.<br>
Also, all files must contain a comment specifying if the work in that file is done by you, or parts of it were received as help from somewhere else (and the source of the help).<br>
Part #2
Improvement ➠ Add comments to your code.<br>
In headers, add comments that describe the purpose of each variable/constant/custom type/function. For functions, the comments should describe how to use it, what is the meaning of the parameters, what is the meaning of the returned value, and if there are any restrictions or special situations to be considered before using it. The header comments are addressed to clients! These comments should help clients decide which entity they need to use in order to achieve some purpose, and how to use it.
In source code files, add comments to describe how the goal is achieved. These comments should help you reconstruct the reasoning later, during maintenance. The source code comments are addressed to maintainers! The maintainers are programmers that must modify the code (fixing bugs, adding features, update functionality, etc.).<br>
